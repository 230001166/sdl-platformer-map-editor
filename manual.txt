SDL Tilemap Editor

Manual



-= Controls =-

Use 1 and 2 to scroll left and right, respectively, through the map's tile palette.

Use B to switch between the foreground and background layers of the map.

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor around the map.

Press S and then type a file name for the map to be saved.

Note : Only letters and the decimal point '.' will work as of right now.

Use Enter to place a tile on the cursor's position.


-= Layout =-

In the top left when starting up the map editor you should see text reading "x <some coordinate> y <some coordinate>".
This is your cursor's position on the map and helps you to find your cursor.

Below that is the map screen. Your cursor will be displayed as whatever tile you have selected.

To the right of the coordinates if you are currently on the background layer of the map, a message reading "BACKGROUND" will appear on the screen.

On the right is your tile palette. These are all of the tiles used in the map.
